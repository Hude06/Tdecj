        One of my original IdealOS blog posts from 2017 showed up on the 
        front page of Hackernews the other day (comments here). 
        This got me thinking about IdealOS again. 
        I haven’t worked on it in a couple of years, 
        but as I read through the comments and links to articles by 
        people with similar ideas, I came to a realization. 
        I am still working on it. Maybe not directly, but I’m still 
        exploring ideas that are needed to build IdealOS. 
        So with that in mind let’s take a look at what I’ve been working on lately.
